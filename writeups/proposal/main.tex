\title{EECS 692: Replication Project Proposal\\
Metric Learning with Adaptive Density Discrimination}
\author{Mohamed El Banani}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Prompt}
Please submit a 1-2 page description of the class project you are proposing.
This should include the paper(s) you are replicating, a brief description of that paper (one to two paragraphs),
which aspect of the work you are replicating, why it is interesting to replicate the work,
and your proposal for doing the replication.
This will include whether you are doing a complete reimplementation or using the original implementation (and some evidence that it is available).
What questions are you going to study in the replication, and possibly what extensions you hope to look into (and why).


I plan on replicating \cite{rippel2016metric}.
